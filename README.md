Twitter, a well-known social media platform, enables users to post and engage with messages called tweets, facilitating rapid and extensive communication and information exchange in real time. Considering the enormous user base and the high volume of daily tweets, an effective search tool is crucial for quickly finding specific topics and discussions. This project aims to develop a sophisticated search tool for Twitter that leverages its comprehensive database to allow users to easily locate information based on usernames, text snippets, and hashtags, while also exploring related content. The project assesses and applies various database technologies to enhance efficient data storage and retrieval. It also incorporates a robust caching system to speed up access to commonly sought-after data. This project outlines the search tool's architecture, data storage methods using both relational and non-relational databases, the caching strategy's efficiency, and the performance of different search queries.Twitter, a well-known social media platform, enables users to post and engage with messages called tweets, facilitating rapid and extensive communication and information exchange in real time.
